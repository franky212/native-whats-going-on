<h1>What's Going On</h1>

<h3>Project description (work in progress):</h3>
<br/>
<p>What's Going On is an app that allows a user to sign up for a basic account, or an event manager to sign up for a business account. Basic users are able to open the app, and see an interactive map with events(Concerts, parties, meetups, conferences, etc.) close to them. They are able to select a a verified event, and purchase tickets (if applicable) from the app right then.</p>
<br/>
<p>Business users, or Event Managers are able to post events to the app; as well as, use the apps ticketing system for basic users to recieve their tickets with QR codes for Event Manager verification. (COMPLEX: Will come later)</p>
<br/>
